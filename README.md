# My CV Site

In this project I will making a CV site that showcase my skills up to now it will be a constant WIP. As I learn more skills I will add to the site.
It will consist 4 pages, a homepage, a about page, a past job page and a why hire me page.


# UX Process:

Who I had in mind when making this site, is potential employers where I can showcase my skills with a site that is easy to navigate. It will be a mobile friendly site thats responsive. 

* As a employer I want to look at this site and navigate to the important sections of the cv site.
* As a user looking to calaborate with site owner, I can look at the site and see the skills and make a decision on if i would work with site owner
* As a employer I can see if it is easy to find a pdf/printable format.
* As a user looking for inspiration the simplistic design can help provide me with inspiration
